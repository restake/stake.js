[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/restake/stake.js/tree/master.svg?style=shield&circle-token=8de591d088f23c001c417fdc7228ddb6e688878d)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/restake/stake.js/tree/master)

`stake.js` is a library designed to simplify the integration of staking functionalities into your applications. This library is blockchain-agnostic, providing a unified interface for staking operations across various netowrks. It allows you to build, sign and broadcast staking transactions without having to worry about the underlying blockchain APIs.

## Dependencies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) â€“ `>= 18.15.x`
- A package manager: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation
To install `stake.js` in your project, run one of the following commands:

If you're using **pnpm**:
```sh
pnpm add @restake/stakejs-ethereum
```

If you're using **yarn**:
```sh
yarn add @restake/stakejs-ethereum
```

If you're using **npm**:
```sh
npm install @restake/stakejs-ethereum
```

## Usage

Below is a simple example of how to use `stake.js` to stake ETH tokens using a Ledger device.
For more examples, check out the [examples](./examples) folder.

```js
import * as fs from "fs";
import { EthereumDepositData, EthereumService } from "@restake/stakejs-ethereum";
import { LedgerNodeWallet } from "@restake/stakejs-ledger-node";

const ethereum = new EthereumService({ name: "goerli" });

const depositData = EthereumDepositData.parse(JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("./secrets/deposit-data.json", "utf8"))[0]);

const wallet = new LedgerNodeWallet();

const txId = await ethereum.tx.stake(wallet, depositData);
console.log(txId);
```

## Supported Protocols

- Ethereum
- NEAR Protocol

Coming soon:
- Sui
- Solana
- Avalanche
- Polkadot

## Design and Features

Behind the scenes, the library does the heavy lifting on the following key areas:

- Managing connection to the blockchain network
- Building protocol-specific `stake`, `deposit`, `unstake`, `withdraw` and `claim` operations
- Signing transactions, handling integrations with wallets and custody solutions, such as:
    - [Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com)
    - [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com)
    - Any custom wallet that implements the `Wallet` interface
- Broadcasting transactions to the blockchain network

We also aim to keep the library as lightweight as possible. `Stake.js` is split in subpackages for each protocol and wallet. Whenever we can, we use libraries that support tree-shaking to decrease package size during bundling.
